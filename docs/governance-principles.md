## Governance principles

1. Absence of data must not be compensated by invention.
2. Authority must be explicit or refused.
3. Confidence is not correctness.
4. Silence is a valid and desirable outcome.
5. Interpretive variance must be observed, not averaged away.
6. Attribution must remain evidence-bound.
7. Normative claims require mandate; otherwise escalate or refuse.
