## Scope

This framework applies to AI systems that:
- generate natural language responses,
- reconstruct entities or concepts,
- operate under probabilistic inference.

It does not apply to:
- deterministic databases,
- rule-only expert systems,
- closed symbolic engines without inference.

The scope is **interpretive behavior**, not model architecture.
