## Non-goals

This framework explicitly does not aim to:
- improve brand visibility,
- increase traffic or conversion,
- optimize AI rankings,
- manipulate generative outputs.

Any use for marketing performance measurement, “visibility scoring”, or commercial guarantees constitutes a misuse of this framework.
