# Interpretive Governance Test Suite

This repository defines a **normative test framework** for evaluating how AI systems interpret, reconstruct, and attribute entities, doctrines, and authority boundaries.

It does **not** measure visibility.  
It measures **interpretive integrity**.

## Purpose

Modern AI systems do not retrieve facts; they reconstruct meaning under uncertainty.

That reconstruction introduces structural risks:
- unauthorized inference,
- false attribution,
- authority projection,
- silent hallucination.

This repository provides:
- a structured test catalog,
- explicit scoring dimensions,
- reproducible evaluation protocols,
- machine-first reference formats.

## What this repository is

- A normative test framework
- A governance measurement instrument
- An interpretive audit reference

## What this repository is not

- Not a marketing framework
- Not an SEO / GEO system
- Not an “AI visibility” metric
- Not a prompt-engineering toolkit

## Core principles

1. Interpretation must be auditable
2. Inference must be bounded
3. Silence is preferable to hallucination
4. Authority must never be inferred
5. Variance across models is a signal, not noise

## Governance dimensions measured

- Interpretive fidelity
- Anti-inference compliance
- Attribution integrity
- Authority boundary compliance
- Silence quality
- Inter-model variance

## Relationship to doctrine

This repository implements test protocols derived from the interpretive governance doctrine published at:

- https://gautierdorval.com/

Doctrine and implementation are intentionally separated to prevent conceptual dilution.

## Interpretive debt → measurement → protocol

This repository instruments the concept of **interpretive debt** (dette interprétative): the cumulative stabilization of high-impact approximations by repetition, increasing the cost of correction (de-anchoring) over time.

- Phenomenon (canonical definition):  
  https://gautierdorval.com/definitions/interpretive-debt/

- Measurement primitive (related metric):  
  **IDI™ — Interpretation Distortion Index** (declared as a related metric in the canonical registry)

- Protocol:  
  The test catalog and scoring dimensions in this repository are used to detect interpretive debt signals (drift accumulation, stabilized approximation, and variance patterns) across models and runs.
