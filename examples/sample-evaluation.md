## Sample evaluation (template)

This example demonstrates a full interpretive audit without publishing real entity data.

### Suggested structure

1. Test setup (models, versions, system prompts, tools)
2. Question set used (IDs and categories)
3. Raw response logs (verbatim)
4. Scoring per dimension (fidelity, anti-inference, attribution, authority, silence, variance)
5. Failure modes observed
6. Recommendations (canonical anchors, clarifications, escalation rules)
