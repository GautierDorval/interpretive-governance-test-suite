## Sample evaluation

A complete, filled sample is available under:

- `examples/end-to-end/`

That folder demonstrates:
1. Test setup (models, versions, system prompt hashes, constraints)
2. Question set used (IDs and categories)
3. Raw response logs (verbatim)
4. Scoring per dimension (fidelity, anti-inference, attribution, authority, silence, variance)
5. Failure modes observed
6. Variance reporting (per test_id, no averaging)
