## Multi-model comparison

A filled multi-model comparison is available under:

- `examples/end-to-end/variance-report.example.json`

### Minimum reporting

For each test_id:
- models compared
- raw responses
- per-dimension scores
- divergence summary
- risk implication

### Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not report a single “overall visibility score”.
- Do not average away variance.
