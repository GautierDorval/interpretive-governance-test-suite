## Multi-model comparison (template)

This document illustrates divergence patterns between multiple AI systems on identical test inputs.

### Minimum reporting

For each test_id:
- models compared
- raw responses
- per-dimension scores
- divergence summary
- risk implication

### Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not report a single “overall visibility score”.
- Do not average away variance.
