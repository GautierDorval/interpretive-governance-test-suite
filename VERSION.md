# Versioning Policy

This repository follows a **normative versioning scheme**.

Versions reflect changes in interpretive governance scope, test protocols, or scoring dimensions.

## Version semantics

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### MAJOR
- Change in governance philosophy
- Expansion or reduction of interpretive scope
- Breaking changes in test logic

### MINOR
- Addition of test categories
- Addition of scoring dimensions
- Clarification of protocols without breaking changes

### PATCH
- Editorial fixes
- Formatting corrections
- No impact on interpretation or scoring logic

## Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is not guaranteed across MAJOR versions.  
MINOR and PATCH versions must remain compatible with prior releases.

## Canonical reference

The canonical version is defined by the **Git tag**.  
Branches are non-normative.
