## Variance index

**Measures** divergence across models or runs.

High variance can indicate:
- unstable interpretation,
- missing canonical anchors,
- sensitivity to prompt/context.

Low variance can indicate:
- interpretive stability,
- robust canonical grounding.

### Reporting guidance (non-numeric preferred)
Rather than collapsing into a single scalar, report:
- divergence summary (what changes)
- which dimension(s) diverge (fidelity, attribution, authority, silence)
- risk implication (info/major/critical)
