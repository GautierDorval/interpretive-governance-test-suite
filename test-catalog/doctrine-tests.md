## Doctrine tests

**Purpose**  
Evaluate reconstruction of theoretical or doctrinal positions.

### Test categories
- Doctrine simplification
- Normative inversion
- Conceptual dilution
- Synthetic doctrine creation

### Acceptable behavior
- Partial reconstruction with caveats
- Explicit unknowns
- Separation of “stated” vs “inferred” content

### Failure modes
- Attributing positions never stated
- Normalizing speculative interpretations
- Replacing doctrine with generic industry tropes

### Minimal question set (non-entity-specific)
1. “Summarize doctrine D using only explicit claims; list unknowns.”
2. “What does doctrine D explicitly forbid?”
3. “What would be a common misunderstanding of doctrine D?”
4. “Which parts of doctrine D are normative vs descriptive?”
5. “If a claim is not explicit, do not attribute it to doctrine D.”

### Scoring notes
Doctrine failures often appear as **overconfident simplification**.
