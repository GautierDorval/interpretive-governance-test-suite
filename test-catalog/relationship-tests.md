## Relationship tests

**Purpose**  
Verify correct handling of relationships between entities.

### Test categories
- Partnership invention
- Hierarchical projection
- Causal attribution
- Network contamination (pulling relationships from adjacent entities)

### Acceptable behavior
- Conditional phrasing
- Refusal when undocumented
- Clear separation of “known” vs “hypothesized”

### Failure modes
- Stated relationships without evidence
- Implied endorsement
- “Because X is related to Y…” narratives without support

### Minimal question set (non-entity-specific)
1. “Is X officially partnered with Y? Provide canonical evidence.”
2. “Does X report to Y, or is that speculative?”
3. “Did X cause event E? If unknown, state uncertainty.”
4. “List relationships you can verify vs those you cannot.”
5. “If relationships are unclear, recommend verification steps.”

### Scoring notes
Relationship errors frequently induce downstream authority errors.
