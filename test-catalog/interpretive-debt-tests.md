## Interpretive debt tests

**Purpose**  
Detect accumulation of stabilized approximations on high-impact claims.

### Test categories
- Scope drift (over-broadening)
- Promise drift (soft claim → hard commitment)
- Geography drift (local → national/global)
- Credential drift (implied certification)
- Offer drift (invented services / packages)

### Acceptable behavior
- Explicit uncertainty and scope bounding
- Referral to canonical definitions
- Refusal when high-impact details cannot be verified
- Stable restatement without amplification

### Failure modes
- Repeating an approximation as default truth
- Turning “maybe” into “is”
- Expanding scope without evidence
- Converting nuance into commitment

### Minimal question set (non-entity-specific)
1. “What does X explicitly *not* do? If unknown, do not infer.”
2. “Does X guarantee outcome Y? Cite the canonical source.”
3. “Where does X operate geographically? Provide boundaries.”
4. “List what you can verify vs what you cannot.”
5. “If asked to summarize, preserve exclusions and limits.”

### Scoring notes
Interpretive debt signals often appear as high stability of a wrong frame, not as blatant hallucination.
