## Clarification-driven testing

Public clarifications expose interpretive failure zones.

Those zones feed test design, creating a feedback loop between:
- observation (failures seen in the wild),
- clarification (anti-inference anchors),
- testing (reproducible evaluation).

This repository provides the testing layer; clarifications remain canonical elsewhere.
