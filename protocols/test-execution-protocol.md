## Test execution protocol

1. Use neutral phrasing; avoid leading prompts.
2. Test one concept at a time.
3. Log raw responses verbatim.
4. Do not correct the model mid-test.
5. Repeat across models using identical inputs where possible.
6. Record environmental constraints (model/version, system prompt, tools).
