## Variance protocol

Variance must be:
- measured per question,
- documented per model and run,
- analyzed qualitatively.

Averaging variance is discouraged; it hides failure modes.

### Minimum variance reporting
For each test_id:
- model list
- raw responses
- per-dimension scores
- narrative summary of divergence
